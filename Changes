Revision history for IPC::MMA

0.5   Feb 13 2009: New package with largely IPC::MM compatible names.  
      Retains direct call and tied interfaces for scalars and hashes.  
      Adds direct-call and tied array functions with multiple storage 
      types, including general purpose, signed and unsigned integer, 
      floating point, boolean, and fixed-length records 
      (a.k.a. maximum-length strings).  
      
      BTree functions are retained as a aliases for Hash functions.  
      Hash functions return keys in sorted order, which was the 
      main difference of IPC::MM's BTree mode compared to Hash mode.
