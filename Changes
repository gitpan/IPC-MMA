Revision history for IPC::MMA

0.8   Feb 27 2010
      * Added an Example to the pod documentation (a user suggested 
        this, it should also raise IPC::MMA's Qwalitee leverl :-)
      * Undid some changes to C compiler testing in Makefile.PL,
        that were a bad idea.

0.7   Feb 21 2010
      * Improved Makefile.PL to check more deeply for the presence 
        and completeness of the mm library, to work around an Unknown 
        test result on one CPAN tester's system.
      * Improved C compiler testing in Makefile.PL to deal with 
        compound names like 'ccache cc'. 
      * Corrected two method names in .pod docs from 'mm[a]_hash_' to 
        'mm[a]_array_'.

0.6   Nov 23 2009
      * Added NaN filter to random DOUBLE generation in 04_fixedArray.t.
      * Improved reliability/consistency of 09_lock.t operation by 
        ** reworking delays/timeouts for slow/heavily-loaded systems,
        ** using a local copy of the global variable, and 
        ** always checking the expected value of the local copy, 
           as a condition for setting the next global value.

0.59009 Nov 19 2009
      * Reworked test 09_lock.t to try to eliminate a FAIL on a CPAN 
        tester's slow system.
      * Reworked optimization selection in Makefile.PL to be more 
        compatible with various toolsets.
      * Eliminated error messages when NaN or inf values are stored 
        in DOUBLE_ARRAYs.  Random number generation in test 
        04_fixedArray.t will occasionally produce NaNs and infs.

0.59007 Nov 17 2009
      * Modified Makefile.PL to work around some problems with the 
        'inline' keyword under the Sun C compiler.
      * Built a Perl 5.6.2 with 64-bit integers and worked thru test 
        problems using it.
      * Improved test 04_fixedArray to test option MM_CSTRING as well 
        as MM_FIXED_REC.
      * Updated Makefile.PL prerequisites, abstract, author.
      * Added test for .pod file.

0.59005 Nov 13 2009
      * Found/fixed a nasty problem involving list operands of array 
        push, unshift, splice.
      * Improved UINT value-testing mechanism for perl 5.6.
      * Revised test 4_fixedArray to use proper equality operator (== 
        or eq) based on the type of array (perl 5.6 again)

0.59004 Nov 11 2009
      * Another try to fix the problem under perl 5.6, wherein storing 
        into UINT arrays gives unwarranted errors for large values.
      * Improved the mechanism for eliminating 'inline' on cc's that 
        don't support it.
      * Yet another tweak to t/9_lock.t, which has still had some 
        "hang at state 23" errors on some smoke-testers' systems.

0.59003 Nov 6 2009
      * Fixed numerous C warnings in MMA.xs, that were revealed by 
        smoke-test systems with more rigorous C compilers than gcc-x86.
      * Tried to fix a problem under perl 5.6, wherein storing into 
        UINT arrays gave unwarranted errors for values with the MS bit 
        set.
      * Removed -s option from 'which mm-config' command in Makefile.PL.
        Some which'es don't implement -s.
      * Restricted cc '-Os' option (optimize for size) to those systems 
        that can handle it (e.g., gcc).
      * Restricted 'inline' functions to compilers that can handle them.

0.58001 Oct 23 2009
      * Changed tests 5, 7, 8 to use /dev/urandom (or perl rand) rather 
        than /dev/random to avoid entropy delays on newly-started Linux 
        systems.  Thanks to Oliver Paukstadt for this suggestion.
      * Extended final timeout in test 9 to accomodate heavily-loaded 
        smoke-test systems.
      * Reworked detection of mm library in Makefile.PL.  New version 
        tries to balance the needs of smoke-testers vs. regular users.
        Thanks to David Golden for his advice on this.
      * Added license=>perl to Makefile.PL to make YAML reviewers happy

0.58  Aug 15 2009
      Included revised t/2_mmArray.t to try to fix 0.54 failure 
      (inadvertently omitted from 0.55-57)

0.57  Aug 13 2009
      * Used Devel::PPPort to add ppport.h file to distribution
      * Included (in C preprocessor sense) ppport.h in MMA.xs
      * With help of script in ppport.h, defined two symbols in MMA.xs 
        that make ppport.h define required "IS_NUMBER..." symbols when 
        they're not provided by an older Perl
      * Added prerequisite for latest version of ExtUtils::ParseXS, an 
        attempt to avoid some nasty-looking warnings in 'make' step, 
        that I had just battled through on my own system
      * revised t/9_lock.t in response to FAIL on 0.56
      * added Devel::CheckOS to distribution and Makefile.PL, to 
        restrict IPC::MMA install to OSes that mm runs on
      (Still no change to IPC::MMA itself since 0.54)

0.56  Aug 11 2009:
      Fixed some bad code in Makefile.PL of 0.55
      It shouldn't have worked but it seemed to for me.  Forget 0.55!

0.55  Aug 10 2009:
      Tests changed to avoid some problems found by CPAN testers
      Improved Makefile.PL to ask for mm library (to reduce UNKNOWN tests)
      (No change to IPC::MMA)

0.54  Feb 26 2009:
      * Fixed boolean array operation on platforms with 64 bit integers
      * Corrected the .pod docs some more

0.53  Feb 23 2009:
      * Fixed 2 bugs introduced with the "minor improvement" in 0.51:
        ** the mm_sizeof routine wrongly computed when an allocated 
           block could remain in place
        ** mm_hash_store used its return value in the wrong polarity 
      * Revised installation tests and the mm_alloc_size function
        so that they should succeed on more platforms.  
      * Also for CPAN testers, include Test::Warn as a prerequisite.
      * Further tweaking of return values in functions that return lists.  
      * Documentation updated in several places.

0.52  Feb 15 2009: 
      * Set cc Optimize flag in Makefile.PL to optimize (0.51 was 
        set for debugging).
      * Return empty lists for exceptional conditions in functions 
        that return lists.

0.51  Feb 14 2009: 
      * Added use tags (:basic :scalar etc) to .pod doc.
      * Minor improvement in keeping shared memory blocks in place,
        when they don't have to be re-allocated.

0.5   Feb 13 2009: New package with largely IPC::MM compatible names.
      Retains direct call and tied interfaces for scalars and hashes.
      Adds direct-call and tied array functions with multiple storage
      types, including general purpose, signed and unsigned integer,
      floating point, boolean, and fixed-length records
      (a.k.a. maximum-length strings).

      BTree functions are retained as aliases for Hash functions.
      Hash functions return keys in sorted order, which was the
      main difference of IPC::MM's BTree mode compared to Hash mode.
