Revision history for IPC::MMA

0.52  Feb 15 2009: cc Optimize flag in Makefile.PL set to optimize
      (0.51 was set for debugging).
      Return empty lists for exceptional conditions in functions that
      return lists.

0.51  Feb 14 2009: Added use tags (:basic :scalar etc) to .pod doc.
      Minor improvement in keeping shared memory blocks in place,
      when they don't have to be re-allocated.

0.5   Feb 13 2009: New package with largely IPC::MM compatible names.
      Retains direct call and tied interfaces for scalars and hashes.
      Adds direct-call and tied array functions with multiple storage
      types, including general purpose, signed and unsigned integer,
      floating point, boolean, and fixed-length records
      (a.k.a. maximum-length strings).

      BTree functions are retained as a aliases for Hash functions.
      Hash functions return keys in sorted order, which was the
      main difference of IPC::MM's BTree mode compared to Hash mode.
